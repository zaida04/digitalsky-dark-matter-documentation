# Definitions

* **Workspace** - The preserved layout of all your windows in Dark Matter. Say you have the control pages on one side, and your fisheye view on the left side. If you wanted to preserve this layout across restarts of the applications or have multiple layouts for different occasions, you would save the layout as a **Workspace**.
* **Fisheye View** - Your view of the universe in a wide angle, intended to mimic the angle and hemispherical image that a 360 Planetarium dome would have.
* **Button** - A collection of instructions that are fed into Dark Matter, commonly referred to as scripting. This allows you to create a show in which actions are done in a predictable and reliable manner \(Ex. say you have a button set that flies you to the moon and then proceeds to let you play among the stars\).
  * There are various types of Buttons in Dark Matter, most commonly used ones being:
    * Regular - a set of instructions that execute once you click
    * Label - a button that only serves to provide a sense of organization within the Button Set.
    * Slider - allow you to choose the intensity/amount of input given to the button script, allow you to change things like the light amount or speed. Can only be used in Live Action.
* **Button Set, or a Control Page** - A collection of similarly related buttons with the ability to organize them using various _Label Buttons_ or dragging around.
* **Asset** - anything that can be considered a resource used inside a _Button_, such as an Image, Text, 3D model, and more. These have to be explicitly loaded in the Button scripts \(imported, whatever you wish to call them\).
* **Window** - a visual area with a clear divider that has a specific purpose
  * Viewport - allows you to see a live render of the universe and how allows you to preview your buttons in real-time
  * Control page - collection of buttons
  * Asset Manager - allows you to manage assets being used in buttons and the general universe
  * ScriptPad - script control
