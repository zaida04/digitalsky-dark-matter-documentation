# Create a button

Now that you have created a control page and have unlocked it, you are ready to start making buttons yourself! You should have noticed that the background of your control page turned into almost like a graph. This is so that you can pixel perfectly align the buttons however you want. _To create a button_ you can right click on the control page area and hit **Create New Button**. After you do that, an object that looks like this will appear:

This is your first button! Congratulations! You can hit the pencil mark at the top left to change the name of the button, or you can hit the trash can icon on the top right in order to delete the button. In our next article, you will learn how to **Manage Assets** related to your buttons, like images, slides, text, and more!
