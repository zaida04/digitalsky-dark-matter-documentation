# Laying out the workspace

There are two states that a window \(like the Control Page\) can have, which are **docked** and **undocked**. Docked means that the window is currently residing in the main Dark Matter window, and is connected to all the other windows. Undocked means that the window is separated from the main Dark Matter window, and is free to be dragged anywhere on your screen.

If you wish to redock an undocked window, simply click on the window name \(usually located on the top left of the window\), and drag it into the main Dark Matter window. As you do so, the main window will give you suggestions as to where you can move the window, allowing you to put in various areas.
